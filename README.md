# python-Tsunami-Vanguard
A non-official python GUI for the Spectra Physics' Vanguard and Tsunami (Millenia pump) laser (and its model lok-to-clock 3930)

-------------------------------------------------------
Config used for testing : 
Windows 7
Python 3.5 (Anaconda 3)
For Tsunami laser + model lok-to-clock 3930
Vanguard laser
(lasers from the company Spectra Physics)
Tried with these lasers CPU only. Maybe adaptable to other lasers

Required libraries :

- PyQt5, with QtDesigner to change the GUI 
- pySerial
pySerial works perfectly in V2 version !

(for the V1 version, pyVisa-py was required, note that pyVisa is also fine))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To just use the GUI :

- Open a command prompt on windows
- just ensure in the code that the paths to the .py files are correct
- copy/paste (right-click, paste) the content of code.txt and press Enter
- Enjoy !
