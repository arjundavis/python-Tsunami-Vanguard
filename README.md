# python-Tsunami-Vanguard
A non-official python GUI for the Spectra Physics' Vanguard and Tsunami (Millenia pump) laser (and its model lok-to-clock 3930)

-------------------------------------------------------
Config used for testing : 
Windows 7
Python 3.5 (Anaconda 3)
For Tsunami laser + model lok-to-clock 3930
Vanguard laser
(lasers from the company Spectra Physics)
Tried with these lasers CPU only. Maybe adaptable to other lasers

Required libraries :

- PyQt5, with QtDesigner to change the GUI 
- pyVisa-py : http://pyvisa-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
(note that pyVisa is also fine)
